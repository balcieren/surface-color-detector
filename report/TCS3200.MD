The TCS3200 sensor is an advanced photometric converter that executes color detection by segregating photons within the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum based on their spectral characteristics. The operational architecture of the sensor is founded on polymer optical filters integrated onto a silicon-based 8x8 photodiode matrix. Functioning as band-pass filters, these elements optically isolate complex ambient light according to wavelengths; for instance, red filters transmit only photons within the 600–700 nm range while absorbing other wavelengths. Photons of specific wavelengths that successfully traverse the filter layer impinge upon the semiconductor surface, triggering the photoelectric effect. The energy carried by these photons excites electrons in the silicon atoms from the valence band to the conduction band, generating free electron-hole pairs; this process yields a photo-current ($I_{ph}$) that is linearly proportional to the irradiance incident upon the surface.

This resultant analog photo-current is processed by the current-to-frequency converter circuit embedded within the sensor's architecture, converting it into a format interpretabale by digital systems. This circuit accumulates the incoming current via an integrator; upon the voltage reaching a specific threshold, it generates a logic pulse and resets itself. An increase in light intensity shortens the charging duration of the integrator capacitor, thereby increasing the number of pulses generated per unit of time—specifically, the frequency. Consequently, a square-wave signal is obtained from the sensor's output pin (OUT), which—in contrast to analog voltage measurements—exhibits high immunity to noise, possesses a 50% duty cycle, and features a frequency directly proportional to the intensity of the target color ($f_o \propto E_e$).
